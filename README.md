# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized TOR Usage
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/jorgegsosa11/threat-hunting-scenario-tor/blob/main/threat-hunting-scenario-tor-event-creation.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Tor Browser

## üìò Scenario

Management suspects that some employees may be using TOR browsers to bypass network security controls. Recent network logs show unusual encrypted traffic patterns and connections to known TOR entry nodes. Additionally, there have been anonymous reports of employees discussing ways to access restricted sites during work hours.

**üéØ Goal**: Detect any TOR usage and analyze related security incidents to mitigate potential risks. If any use of TOR is found, notify management.

---

## üîç High-Level TOR IoC Discovery Plan

- ‚úÖ Check `DeviceFileEvents` for any `tor.exe` or `firefox.exe` file events  
- ‚úÖ Check `DeviceProcessEvents` for signs of TOR browser installation or usage  
- ‚úÖ Check `DeviceNetworkEvents` for outgoing connections over known TOR ports (`443`, `9001`, `9030`, `9050`)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Taken

### üîπ Step 1: File Event Detection

Searched `DeviceFileEvents` for any file with the string `"tor"` in it. Discovered that user `jorge_lab` downloaded a TOR installer and extracted many TOR-related files to the Desktop, along with creating a file named `something.txt`.

**KQL Query:**
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName startswith "jorge"
| where FileName contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14."
| order by TimeGenerated desc 
| project TimeGenerated, DeviceName, ActionType, FolderPath, SHA256, account = InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

---

## üîπ Step 2: TOR Browser Execution Detection

Searched `DeviceProcessEvents` for `ProcessCommandLine` containing the TOR browser executable.

- **üìÖ Date**: June 5, 2025  
- **‚è∞ Time**: 04:30 AM UTC  
- **üë§ User**: `jorge_lab`  
- **üíª Device**: `jorge-test-mach`  
- **üìå Action**: TOR Browser installer (`tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.3.exe`) was manually executed from the Downloads folder.

**üîç KQL Query:**

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "jorge-test-mach"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.3.exe"
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, ProcessCommandLine

```

---

## üîπ Step 3: Confirmed TOR Browser Launch

Searched `DeviceProcessEvents` again for any indication that `tor.exe`, `firefox.exe`, or other TOR executables were run.

- **Date:** June 5, 2025  
- **Time:** 04:31 AM UTC  
- **Observation:** TOR's `firefox.exe` was launched from the Tor Browser folder. The initiating process was the installer identified earlier.

### üîç KQL Query:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "jorge-test-mach"
| where FileName in~ ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe", "start-tor-browser.exe", "torbrowser.exe")
  or FileName has_any ("tor-browser", "torbrowser", "torbrowser-install", "torbrowser-launcher")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, FileName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| sort by Timestamp desc
```

---

## üîπ Step 4: TOR Network Communication Detected

Checked `DeviceNetworkEvents` for outgoing TOR-related connections over known ports: 443, 9001, 9030, 9050.

- **Date:** June 5, 2025  
- **Time:** ~04:32 AM UTC  

### Observation:
- Connection to `65.109.67.160` on port `443`  
- Connection to `37.120.184.36` on port `9001`  

These indicate successful TOR communications.

### üîç KQL Query:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "jorge-test-mach"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName != "system"
| where RemotePort in (80, 443, 9001, 9030, 9050)
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ ("tor.exe", "firefox.exe", "start-tor-browser.exe", "torbrowser.exe")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath
| sort by Timestamp desc

```

# Chronological Event Log: Tor Activity Threat Hunt - jorge_lab

This document outlines the chronological sequence of events related to the detection and investigation of Tor Browser activity on the **jorge-test-mach** device, associated with the user **jorge_lab**. The timeline is constructed from various security logs and observations during the threat hunt.

---

## Event Timeline

### June 5, 2025, 04:28 AM UTC - Tor Browser Download and Execution
- **Action:** A file named `tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.3.exe` was identified as having been downloaded and subsequently executed.  
- **User:** jorge_lab  
- **Device:** jorge-test-mach  
- **Location:** The executable was run from the Downloads folder.  
- **Details:** This event indicates the manual download and initial execution of the Tor Browser installer by the user. The process was recorded as being created.

---

### June 5, 2025, 04:28 AM UTC (Approx.) - Tor Files Copied to Desktop
